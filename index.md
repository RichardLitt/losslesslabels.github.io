###What:
Praising labels that lossless downloads. Shaming those who don't. 

###Why:

When you buy an LP, you're not just buying physical media - you're buying a much better quality version of the original recording than you're going to get from iTunes, Spotify, or your standard CD rip. Lossless audio formats are comparable - these generally have a bitrate from 800-1200kbps, and the sound is much richer and deeper because of it. However, the files are large, and, due to storage space on servers and the lack of demand, they often aren't offered to buyers of LPs to download, although they already have bought the album.

Audiophiles who care are a minority. But the potential for more people to care about audio quality is limited only by population size. Wouldn't it be great if more people knew about lossless audio formats? Wouldn't it be awesome if this change started with the labels offering lossless versions for free to those who've bought digital mp3s or LPs?

We think so. So here is our list of labels that do, or do not.
